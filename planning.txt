Maybe consider having a `spindle` of names and a fixed picker. Kinda like those casino games. Wheel of fortune esque

- DONE: Plan to get rid of the weird reloading bug. It was just the continuous build tool
- Plan to have weighted selection of names
- DONE: allow for custom cadence  


Next steps
- look into connecting to phone or email, look into firebase
- look to make this an api so you can automatically call it
- grid of all your friends with health bars representing who you need to call
- well say that the spindle can randomly select anyone but places extra emphasis on friends whos expiration date is close if not already passed
- allow spindle on full grid of names
